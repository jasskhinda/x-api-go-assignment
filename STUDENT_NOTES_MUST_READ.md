# STUDENT NOTES: PLEASE MUST READ

### To: Professor Maziar Sojoudian

## Overview:
I faced issues while working on the X.com API OAuth process. I have followed all the steps provided in the assignment, but there is a problem with the OAuth authentication when posting or deleting a tweet (now called a post).

## What I Did:

1. **X.com Developer Account Setup**:
   - Created a developer account and app.
   - Generated the required API keys, tokens, and client ID/secret.

2. **Implemented OAuth Flow in Go**:
   - I followed the instructions and implemented the OAuth flow.
   - The app correctly generates the OAuth URL and redirects to X.com for authentication.

3. **Testing OAuth in Browser**:
   - I tested the OAuth flow in different browsers, but I kept getting the error: **"Something went wrong. You werenâ€™t able to give access to the App."**

4. **Additional Steps Taken**:
   - I regenerated the API keys and tokens.
   - I checked X.com's OAuth documentation and tried logging the OAuth URL to test it manually.
   - I also ensured that the Callback URL is correct in the developer portal.

## Request for Assistance:
I believe everything is correct from my end, but I need help resolving this OAuth issue. I kindly ask for guidance on how to fix this problem.
